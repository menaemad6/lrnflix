# AI Image Generation System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive AI image generation system integrated into the Learnify platform. The system allows teachers to generate custom course thumbnails using AI based on text descriptions, with the ability to select from multiple variations and upload directly to storage.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Gemini Image Generation Utility (`src/utils/geminiImageGenerator.ts`)

**Core Functionality:**
- Generates images using Google's Gemini API based on text descriptions
- Supports multiple image styles: realistic, artistic, cartoon, abstract, minimalist
- Configurable aspect ratios: 1:1, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2
- Quality settings: low, medium, high
- Enhanced prompt engineering for better educational content generation

**Key Functions:**
- `generateImages()` - Main function to generate images from descriptions
- `validateImageGenerationParams()` - Input validation
- `getAvailableStyles()` - Returns available style options
- `getAvailableAspectRatios()` - Returns available aspect ratio options

**Features:**
- Generates 2 variations per request for user choice
- Automatic prompt enhancement for educational context
- Error handling and validation
- Base64 to blob URL conversion for preview

### 2. Image Generation Hook (`src/hooks/useImageGeneration.ts`)

**State Management:**
- Tracks generation progress, selected images, upload status
- Manages error states and user feedback
- Handles blob URL cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Key Features:**
- Integration with existing `useImageUpload` hook
- Automatic image selection after generation
- Regeneration capabilities
- Progress tracking for uploads
- Comprehensive error handling

**Hook Interface:**
```typescript
const {
  isGenerating,
  generatedImages,
  selectedImage,
  error,
  isUploading,
  uploadProgress,
  uploadedImageUrl,
  generateImages,
  selectImage,
  uploadSelectedImage,
  regenerateImages,
  clearGeneratedImages,
  resetState,
} = useImageGeneration(options);
```

### 3. Reusable Image Generator Component (`src/components/ui/ImageGenerator.tsx`)

**UI Features:**
- Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time generation status indicators
- Image selection interface with visual feedback
- Upload progress tracking
- Error display and handling
- Style and aspect ratio selection dropdowns

**Component Props:**
- `bucket` - Storage bucket for uploads
- `folder` - Optional folder path
- `title` - Customizable component title
- `description` - Component description

- `onError` - Error handling callback

**User Experience:**
- Intuitive image selection with hover effects
- Clear visual feedback for selected images
- Loading states and progress indicators
- One-click upload to storage
- Easy regeneration of new variations

### 4. Integration with CourseDetails Component

**Location:** `src/pages/teacher/CourseDetails.tsx`

**Integration Points:**
- Added to the Settings tab of course management
- Uses `COURSE_IMAGES` bucket for storage
- Integrated with existing image upload workflow
- Maintains consistency with existing UI patterns

**Features Added:**
- AI thumbnail generator specifically for course thumbnails

**Request Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxOutputTokens: 1024,
  responseMimeType: "image/png"
}
```

### Image Processing

**Blob URL Management:**
- Converts base64 data to blob URLs for preview
- Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- File conversion for upload to storage

**Upload Integration:**
- Seamless integration with existing `useImageUpload` hook
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Automatic file naming and organization

### Error Handling

**Comprehensive Error Management:**
- API key validation
- Network error handling
- Image generation failures
- Upload failures
- User input validation

**User Feedback:**
- Toast notifications for all states
- Loading indicators
- Error messages with actionable information
- Success confirmations

## Usage Instructions

### For Teachers

1. **Navigate to Course Settings:**
   - Go to your course management page
   - Click on the "Settings" tab

2. **Generate AI Thumbnail:**
   - Scroll to the "AI Course Thumbnail Generator" section
   - Enter a detailed description of your desired thumbnail
   - Select style and aspect ratio preferences
   - Click "Generate Images"

3. **Select and Upload:**
   - Review the generated variations
   - Click on your preferred image to select it
   - Click "Upload to Storage" to save the image
   - The thumbnail will be automatically updated for your course

### Example Descriptions

**Good Examples:**
- "A modern classroom with students learning programming, clean and professional"
- "Abstract representation of mathematics with geometric shapes and formulas"
- "Colorful illustration of science experiments with test tubes and beakers"
- "Minimalist design showing a graduation cap and diploma"

**Style Recommendations:**
- **Realistic:** For professional, photo-like thumbnails
- **Artistic:** For creative, expressive designs
- **Cartoon:** For fun, engaging content
- **Abstract:** For conceptual, modern designs
- **Minimalist:** For clean, simple thumbnails

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variable is set:
```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Supabase Storage

Create the following storage bucket:
```sql
-- Create course_images bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('course_images', 'course_images', true);
```

### Storage Policies

Configure appropriate storage policies for the `course_images` bucket:
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'course_images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'course_images');
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
